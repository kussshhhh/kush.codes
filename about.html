            <p>hi i am kush, a compsci undergrad currently in 2nd year. </p> <p></p> <p>i'm doing an experiment with my life and this website is  a part of it. </p> <p>here are some things about me:</p> <ul> <li> - i think differently than most.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> - i like to try out and experiment if what i'm thinking is right. </li> </ul> <h3> the theory</h3> <p>ok so the basics first:</p> <p>i have a theory, that for a person to build something(a startup/ company/product/software) he needs to max out on two things</p> <p>context+ logic ; </p> <p>if you have these two down given that you've high agency you can do almost anything. </p> <p>logic/ mathematical thinking cannot be maxxed in one month or even in a year. it is a continous process. here's how i like to think about this. </p> <p>let's assume that i'm dumb but now that i have chosen my game(building my own company) i want to increase my chances that i win. here's how i do it. by trying to increase my iq and logical thinking so that i can process large amount of context and make meaningful pivoting decisions. so i have to work on my reasoning everyday such that it remains sharp and i always have a framework to rely upon. </p> <p>second depending on how big the problem is gaining context can take anything from one minute to a few months. </p> <p>but context is just a matter of time. context is a term that shows itself in different forms. if you zoom out it's the domain knowledge. if you zoom in it is the programming know how of making  software and gaining the context of the problem you are trying to solve.</p> <h3> my goal(what i am hoping to achieve)</h3> <p>my goal is to build products that can help humanity in some small but meaningful way and in return bring me shitloads of money. </p> <h3> what i am runnning from</h3> <p>i hate the concept of jobs and for someone else to be my boss. i like to have control and freedom and i would like it to continue being that way. i have no problem in working  under someone for a while given that the person knows how to make the things go round and knows how to play the game, in a way be my mentor.</p> <h3> my plan</h3> <p>this is the plan i'm betting my life on :</p> <p>bruteforce and iterations</p> <p></p> <h3># for logic</h3> <p>just after waking up give a session of three hours to codeforces. everyday. </p> <p></p> <p>i don't have to worry about context for now. for now the initial years i will hone my coding and work with startups and understand how they work and what problems they are working on. it will give me a sense where the money actually is. </p> <p>what i'm doing is training myself and to gain the whole context of codebase of a yc startup or any other startup on github and contribute there to then get hired by them. then gain the whole context of their business and do it with as many startups  as it takes until i've figured out what i want my startup to be like. so when i'm ready i'll have money to stay afloat. </p> <p></p> <h3># a day in the life of kush</h3> <ul> <li> - wake up and do codeforces for 2-3 hours </li> </ul> <ul> <li> - the rest of the day: code for startups(or attempt to) </li> </ul> <h3> contact me </h3> <p>if you want to work with me or just want to say hi slide into my dms on  <a href="https://twitter.com/kucchi09">twitter</a></p> <p> or email me at kushsep21@gmail.com</p>
