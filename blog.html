    when i say hacking i refer to building things or hacking processes not only hacking pcs
    
    hacking is a basic human nature.
    
    some people consider hacking to be a shortcut thing, but let me tell you hacking is good honest work.
    
    because if you think a little, every human advancement until now can be considered hacking in some sense, early humans 
    'hacked' the system by discovering fire, it is basically finding an optimal solution to a problem which was until then 
    solved by using brute force and nothing
    
      
    
    by 'hacking' the system so that our relative survival is ensured and that also by using less manpower/ effort/ compute.
    
      
    
    because of this we've now freed up our compute, so that we can play with a higher level of existence and this cycle is 
    continued cause we're now chasing being gods.
    
      
    
    every generation has these 'hackers' which have freed up their compute and are now chasing a higher level of existence. 
    but there are two pitholes
    
    1) in this. if somebody else has freed up your compute(i.e. you're standing on the shoulder of giants) so now it wasn't 
    you who hacked but your forefathers and the generation before you or you've got free time due to bad govt or a crack in 
    the system, so now you've this free time but don't know what to do with it. you're now being miserable because you lack 
    purpose until urgency comes and your survival is at stake, so you work but just enough to get you over the next hump only 
    to be miserable yet again.
    
    2) the intermediate as well as final products of hacking are generally governed by free markets and so you wouldn't know 
    what to do with it and they may not be earned by you so will get dumbed down because market will get you addicted so that
     you work and put your money in the market. there's also a few threads which sprout from this point but i'll stop for now
    
      
    
    be a "hacker" kid, in spirit
    
      
      
    
    ps: if you know the basics as if you yourself derived it, then you can work with them in a way to make something so simple
     yet complex by twisting and turning the basics which someone who just uses the predefined frameworks cannot think of achieving
    
    this new thing is novel and changes the understanding of basics and adds a whole new dimension to it
