            <p>10- 02-2024</p><p>when i say hacking i refer to building things or hacking processes not only hacking pcs</p><p>hacking is a basic human nature. </p><p>some people consider hacking to be a shortcut thing, but let me tell you hacking is good honest work.</p><p>because if you think a little, every human advancement until now can be considered hacking in some sense, early humans 'hacked' the system by discovering fire, it is basically finding an optimal solution to a problem which was until then solved by using brute force and nothing </p><p></p><p>by 'hacking' the system so that our relative survival is ensured and that also by using less manpower/ effort/ compute.</p><p></p><p>because of this we've now freed up our compute, so that we can play with a higher level of existence and this cycle is continued cause we're now chasing being gods. </p><p></p><p>every generation has these 'hackers' which have freed up their compute and are now chasing a higher level of existence. but there are two pitholes</p><p>	1) in this. if somebody else has freed up your compute(i.e. you're standing on the shoulder of giants) so now it wasn't you who hacked but your forefathers and the generation before you or you've got free time due to bad govt or a crack in the system, so now you've this free time but don't know what to do with it. you're now being miserable because you lack purpose until urgency comes and your survival is at stake, so you work but just enough to get you over the next hump only to be miserable yet again.</p><p>	2) the intermediate as well as final products of hacking are generally governed by free markets and so you wouldn't know what to do with it and they may not be earned by you so will get dumbed down because market will get you addicted so that you work and put your money in the market. there's also a few threads which sprout from this point but i'll stop for now </p><p></p><p>be a "hacker" kid, in spirit </p><p></p><p></p><p>ps: if you know the basics as if you yourself derived it, then you can work with them in a way to make something so simple yet complex by twisting and turning the basics which someone who just uses the predefined frameworks cannot think of achieving</p><p>this new thing is novel and changes the understanding of basics and adds a whole new dimension to it </p><p></p><p>16-02-2024</p><p></p><p>i want to go to a beach town and live there for some years and go for night runs</p><p></p><p>19-02-2024</p><p></p><p>i get what i want, only when there's no reason i wouldn't. it's like i'm in a negotiating battle with god. </p><p>optimal solutions/paths don't work for me. i have to overwhelm my goal and then can i only achieve it. took a while to realise this.</p><p></p><p>anyways 19-22 of feb, i'll be on my codeforces grind to pupil. </p><p>current rating - 1079</p><p>contest is on 23 feb. will update </p><p></p><p>remember to overwhelm the goal.</p><p></p><p>p.s: young money nicki minaj justiiiceeee</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
